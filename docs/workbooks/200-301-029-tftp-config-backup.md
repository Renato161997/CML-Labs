# TFTP Config Backup

## Scope and prerequisites

TFTP is intentionally unencrypted and restricted to the isolated link. Only the educational R2 startup configuration is served; it contains no real credentials. The destination is a separate flash file. File-prompt quiet avoids an interactive destination prompt in this disposable lab.

Use licensed reference images for iosv in CML 2.10.1. All addresses are educational. No Internet, external connector or production credentials are required. Starting state: Working isolated reference baseline. Functional status and exact tested images: [results](../../validation/RESULTS.md).

## Topology and addressing

- R1 GigabitEthernet0/0 <-> R2 GigabitEthernet0/0

| Node | Interface | Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Loopback0 | `ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.255` |
| R1 | GigabitEthernet0/0 | `ip address 198.18.0.1 255.255.255.252` |
| R2 | Loopback0 | `ip address 192.0.2.2 255.255.255.255` |
| R2 | GigabitEthernet0/0 | `ip address 198.18.0.2 255.255.255.252` |

## Tasks

1. Identify the permitted TFTP client and the served startup configuration.
2. Transfer the isolated reference configuration into a separate client file.
3. Inspect the copied content without replacing running or startup configuration.

## Baseline acceptance

| Node | Command | Observable result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `ping 198.18.0.2 repeat 3` | The TFTP server is reachable. |

## Transition: download reference configuration

On **R1**:

```ios
copy tftp://198.18.0.2/startup-config flash:lab-backup.cfg
```

- R1: `more flash:lab-backup.cfg | include hostname` -- The copied file contains the server hostname, not the client configuration.

## Reference configuration and recovery

The checked-in topology carries the reference configurations below. To reset a disposable exercise, stop and wipe only your imported copy, then restart or import the YAML again. Never apply the fault actions to a production device. Fault transitions restore the routing baseline; file-copy exercises may leave their documented output until wipe. Repeat the applicable acceptance checks before ending the exercise.

### R1

```ios
hostname R1
no ip domain-lookup
no service config
ip cef
line console 0
 exec-timeout 0 0
 logging synchronous
 exit
interface Loopback0
 ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.255
 no shutdown
 exit
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 198.18.0.1 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
 exit
file prompt quiet
end
```

### R2

```ios
hostname R2
no ip domain-lookup
no service config
ip cef
line console 0
 exec-timeout 0 0
 logging synchronous
 exit
interface Loopback0
 ip address 192.0.2.2 255.255.255.255
 no shutdown
 exit
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 198.18.0.2 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
 exit
access-list 90 permit host 198.18.0.1
tftp-server nvram:startup-config 90
end
```

## Platform scope

[IOSv feature support](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/modeling-labs/iosv/) and [IOSvL2 feature support](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/modeling-labs/iosvl2/) describe the software platforms. This exercise verifies routing/control behavior, not hardware throughput, physical failure timing or certification coverage. A catalog entry is only marked passed after actual console acceptance and cleanup.
